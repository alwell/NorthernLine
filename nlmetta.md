**Short Description** 
50 Tube stations on the Northern Line photographed at dusk and dawn. Transport for London staff has placed some enlightening quotes at the entrance to some of the stations. This book shares the author's reflection on these quotes and his links to resources, to progress the reader to a 'higher dream', a 'high' reality.  

**Long Description**


The Tube: grimy, smelly, crowded, necessary and efficient. There were about 294 million passenger journeys recorded in 2016/17 on the Northern Line, making it the busiest on the Underground (Northern line, 2019). We could perhaps describe the tube as a bitter remedy for transport.

Emerging from this grime are some enlightening quotes that the TFL (Transport for London) staff have placed at the entrance to some of the stations (Figure). It as if they are preparing the traveller for something deeper and higher. Many travellers like the quotes, they stop and take pictures. Blogs, social media, websites have been set up to share the quotes. The quotes embrace fundamental truths about life, about the world. They stimulate us to deeper thought and deeper reflection. But can we progress to a `higher dream', a higher reality from the quotes?

The author has used the Northern Line on a daily commute for seven years, but he understands that there is also another journey which can be undertaken each day. The journey to the `direct understanding' of reality as it is. This is a solitary journey, something that you yourself have to undertake, others can just point the way (MORDEN DEPOT). As he read these quotes, he reflects on that journey and the relevance of the quotes to that journey.  The purpose of this book is to share his reflection with you and to point you to a rich set of free resources that he has available.  Alan is using these quotes as a trigger to progress you, the reader, to a `higher reality'.

## About the author

**Name:** Alan Weller 	**Role:** Author	

**Biography**
While studying physics at Kent University, Alan developed a keen interest in photography which led to a career in photojournalism lasting for 30 years. During this time he has had pictures published throughout the world in various media ranging from The New York Times to Vogue. It was while working in London at The Times newspaper that he developed an interest in teaching both professionally, through educational assignments, and personally, through tutoring his sons in science. He decided to retrain and in 2008 obtained a PGCE from the Institute of Education in Secondary Physics. He has since taught science in both the private and state sectors, including grammar and comprehensive, mixed and single-sex schools, at key stage 3, 4 and 5
. 
In 2012, he joined the Cass School of Education at The University of East London as a Senior Lecturer in Physics responsible for training secondary science trainee teachers. 

In 1978 he was given a Buddhist book on the Abhidhamma by a friend. Within the first 10 or so pages, he understood that there was a possibility of another way of understanding the world and a different way of studying the world. In 1994, he started a publishing company, Zolag, to make this and other books available. 

He retired from UEL in 2018 and is currently continuing his work at Zolag publishing. He also recently become a student again at Morley College to learn electric guitar

**Prior Work:**

During his time at UEL he gave 3 presentations on two topics to research conferences, UEL, ICERI and TEAN. ‘Higher Learning, higher reality...’  and ‘5 Misconceptions on mindfulness and why they may be harming school pupils.’ The papers accompanying the 
the presentations can be accessed below.
