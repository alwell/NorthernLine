50 Tube stations on the Northern Line photographed at dusk and dawn. Transport for London staff have placed some enlightening quotes at the entrance to some of the stations. This book shares the photographer's reflection on 51 quotes and links to resources, to progress the reader to a 'higher dream', a 'high' reality.
