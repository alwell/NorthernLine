# The Northern Line to Morden via quotes

![Tooting Broadway](bec.jpeg)

The Tube; grimy; smelly; crowded; necessary and efficient. There were about 294 million passenger journeys recorded in 2016/17 on the Northern line, making it the busiest on the Underground (Wikipedia). We could perhaps describe the tube as a bitter remedy for transport.

Amazingly, emerging from this grime are some enlightening quotes that the TFL staff have placed at the entrance to some of the stations. It as if they are preparing the traveller for something deeper and higher. The purpose of this project is to juxtapose pictures of each tube station on the Northern Line with quotes taken from the Northern Line.

There will be 50 pictures of the stations taken in half light. At night time, the stations take on a different personalty and often become the main focal point of the community. The are like miniature temples lighting up their surroundings.
